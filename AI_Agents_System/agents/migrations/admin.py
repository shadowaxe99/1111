I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The file "admin.py" is not typically located in the "migrations" directory. It's usually found in the main app directory. Therefore, the correct path should be "AI_Agents_System/agents/admin.py". Here's the code for that file:


from django.contrib import admin
from .models import FrontEndAgent, MidRevAgent, BackEndAgent

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(FrontEndAgent)
admin.site.register(MidRevAgent)
admin.site.register(BackEndAgent)
